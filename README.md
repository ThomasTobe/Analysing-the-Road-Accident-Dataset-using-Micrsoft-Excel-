# Analysing-the-Road-Accident-Dataset-using-Micrsoft-Excel-
This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project on road accidents. Leveraging a dataset obtained from Kaggle, I conducted an in-depth exploration of the data using Microsoft Excel. The goal of the analysis was to identify key trends and insights related to casualties in traffic accidents, ultimately contributing to the improvement of road safety.

Using various Excel features, functions, and tools, I performed essential calculations, generated visual representations of the data, and presented the findings in a clear and concise manner. The project employed a range of analytical techniques, including data cleaning, manipulation, analysis and visualization using charts and graphs.

The analysis focused on several key performance indicators (KPIs), such as the total number of casualties by accident severity, vehicle type, road type, and other factors. Additionally, it explored secondary KPIs, including monthly trends, maximum casualties by road type, and the distribution of casualties by road surface conditions.
